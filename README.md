### Hi there 👋

- :octocat: Looking for anything useful then head over to [DanOpsTech](https://github.com/danopstech)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Golang and writing Prometheus exporters to monitor everything in my house.
- 📡 A little obsessed with [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/) (I'm sure it will wear off)

### Whats Next ⏱️

- 🐙 I have [Octopus](https://octopus.energy/) Energy smart meter install soon, so time to write another Prometheus exporter to monitor my energy usage
